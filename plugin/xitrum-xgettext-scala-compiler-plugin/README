This is a compiler plugin for Scala that acts like xgettext to extract string
resources to gettext po file.

See http://www.scala-lang.org/node/140

This compiler plugin checks if there's an empty i18n.pot file in the current
working directory, then it will fill that file with string resources.

See dev/README.rst to know how to publish to Sonatype.
