Xitrum (means "Smurf" in Vietnamese) is an async and clustered Scala web framework
and web server on top of `Netty <http://www.jboss.org/netty>`_
and `Hazelcast <http://www.hazelcast.com/>`_:

* It fills the gap between `Scalatra <https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra>`_
  and `Lift <http://liftweb.net/>`_: more powerful than Scalatra and easier to
  use than Lift. You can easily create both RESTful APIs and postbacks. Xitrum
  is controller-first like Scalatra, not
  `view-first <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/View_First>`_ like Lift.
* Annotation is used for URL routes, in the spirit of JAX-RS. You don't have to
  declare all routes in a single place.
* Typesafe, in the spirit of Scala.
* Async, in the spirit of Netty.
* Sessions can be stored in cookies or clustered Hazelcast.
* `jQuery Validation <http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation>`_ is integrated
  for browser side and server side validation.
* i18n using `GNU gettext <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_gettext>`_,
  which means unlike most other solutions, both singular and plural
  forms are supported.
* Conditional GET using ETag.

Hazelcast also gives:

* In-process and distribued cache, you don't need separate cache servers.
* In-process and clustered `Comet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)>`_,
  you can scale Comet to multiple web servers.
