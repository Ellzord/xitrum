Things that are usually used by application developers are put here for
convenience. Because when they want to use XXX, they simply write:

import xitrum.XXX

To avoid polluting this namespace, things that are utilities should be put in
xitrum.util package, not here.

Annotations and validators are put to
xitrum.annation and
xitrum.validator
because there are many of them. It's better for application
developers to write:

import xitrum.annotation._
import xitrum.validator._
